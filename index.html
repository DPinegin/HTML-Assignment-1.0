      This is the header with the name of the website ("the Historion") and the 
      navigation pane that a user can click to be brought to the next web-pages. I used CSS to 
      make the navigation pane more eye-pleasing by adding background color, and a 
      hover color to make it seem like a button and indicate the fact that the link is clickable.

      <!--
        I centered the name of the website for better visibility (because it will display on 
        almost every page of the whole website), and added a sub-heading for the heading as a quick motto-type thing.
        For the heading, I used the <h1> tags (centered), and for the motto I used the <p> tags and <b> for bolding the text.
