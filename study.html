        I centered the name of the website for better visibility (because it will display on

        <h3>The Minoan Civilization</h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age Aegean civilization 
          on the island of Crete and other Aegean Islands, whose 
          earliest beginnings were from <b> 3500 BC</b>, with the complex 
          urban civilization beginning around <b>2000 BC</b>, and then declining 
          from <b>1450 BC</b> until it ended around <b>1100 BC</b>, during the early 
          Greek Dark Ages. It represents the <b>first advanced civilization 
          in Europe</b>, leaving behind a number of massive building complexes, 
          sophisticated art, and writing systems. Its economy benefited from
          a network of <u>trade around much of the Mediterranean</u>(Wikipedia).
        </p>

        <p>
          The Minoans built large and elaborate palaces up to four storeys high, 
          featuring elaborate plumbing systems and decorated with frescoes. 
          <b>The largest Minoan palace is that of Knossos</b>, followed by that of 
          Phaistos. The function of the palaces, like most aspects of Minoan 
          governance and religion, remains unclear. The Minoan period saw extensive 
          trade by Crete with Aegean and Mediterranean settlements, particularly 
          those in the Near East. Through traders and artists, Minoans cultural 
          influence reached beyond Crete to <u>the Cyclades, the Old Kingdom of Egypt, 
          copper-bearing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast and Anatolia</u>. Some 
          of the best Minoan art was preserved in the city of Akrotiri on the island 
          of Santorini; Akrotiri had been effectively destroyed by the Minoan eruption (Wikipedia).
        </p>

        <p>
          The Minoans primarily wrote in the Linear A script and also in Cretan 
          hieroglyphs, encoding a language hypothetically labelled Minoan. The 
          reasons for the slow decline of the Minoan civilization, beginning 
          around 1550 BC, are unclear; theories include Mycenaean invasions 
          from mainland Greece and the major volcanic eruption of Santorini (Wikipedia).
