      <h3>The Culture and Lifestyle of the Minoans</h3>
      <!--Here is another webpage that describes the Minoan civilization's culture. 
      It is seperate from the other webpages because it is not an introduction and it is not
      a description of the Minoan's geographical location.  -->
      <h4>Culture and Society</h4>
      <p>
        Apart from the abundant local agriculture, the Minoans were also a
        mercantile people who engaged significantly in overseas trade, and at
        their peak may well have had a dominant position in international trade
        over much of the Mediterranean. After 1700 BC, their culture indicates a
        high degree of organization. Minoan-manufactured goods suggest a network
        of trade with mainland Greece (notably Mycenae), Cyprus, Syria,
        Anatolia, Egypt, Mesopotamia and westward as far as the Iberian
        peninsula. The term palace economy was first used by Evans of Knossos.
        It is now used as a general term for ancient pre-monetary cultures where
        much of the economy revolved around the collection of crops and other
        goods by centralized government or religious institutions (the two
        tending to go together) for redistribution to the population. This is
        still accepted as an important part of the Minoan economy; all the
        palaces have very large amounts of space that seems to have been used
        for storage of agricultural produce, some remains of which have been
        excavated after they were buried by disasters. What role, if any, the
        palaces played in Minoan international trade is unknown, or how this was
        organized in other ways. The decipherment of Linear A would possibly
        shed light on this (Wikipedia).

      <h4>Government</h4>
      <p>
        Very little is known about the forms of Minoan government; the Minoan
        language has not yet been deciphered. It used to be believed that the
        Minoans had a monarchy supported by a bureaucracy. This might initially
        have been a number of monarchies, corresponding with the "palaces"
        around Crete, but later all taken over by Knossos, which was itself
        later occupied by Mycenaean overlords. But, in notable contrast to
        contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, "Minoan
        iconography contains no pictures of recognizable kings", and in recent
        decades it has come to be thought that before the presumed Mycenaean
        invasion around 1450, a group of elite families, presumably living in
        the "villas" and the palaces, controlled both government and
        religion(Wikipedia).
      </p>

      <h4>Language and Writing</h4>
      <p>
        Minoan is an unclassified language, or perhaps multiple indeterminate
        languages written in the same script. It has been compared
        inconclusively to the
        <u>Indo-European and Semitic language families</u>, as well as to the
        proposed <u>Tyrsenian languages</u> or an unclassified
        <u>pre-Indo-European language family</u>. Several writing systems dating
        from the Minoan period have been unearthed in Crete, the majority of
        which are currently undeciphered. The most well-known script is Linear
        A, dated to between 2500 BC and 1450 BC. Linear A is the parent of the
        related Linear B script, which encodes the earliest known form of
        Greek.[90] and is also found elsewhere in the Aegean. The dating of the
        earliest examples of Linear B from Crete is controversial, but is
        unlikely to be before 1425 BC; it is assumed that the start of its use
        reflects conquest by Mycenae. Several attempts to translate Linear A
        have been made, but consensus is lacking and Linear A is currently
        considered undeciphered. The language encoded by Linear A is tentatively
        dubbed "Minoan". When the values of the symbols in Linear B are used in
        Linear A, they produce unintelligible words, and would make Minoan
        unrelated to any other known language. There is a belief that the
        Minoans used their written language primarily as an accounting tool and
        that even if deciphered, may offer little insight other than detailed
        descriptions of quantities. Linear A is preceded by about a century by
        the Cretan hieroglyphs. It is unknown whether the language is Minoan,
        and its origin is debated. Although the hieroglyphs are often associated
        with the Egyptians, they also indicate a relationship to Mesopotamian
        writings.[91] They came into use about a century before Linear A, and
        were used at the same time as Linear A (18th century BC; MM II). The
        hieroglyphs disappeared during the 17th century BC (MM III). The
        Phaistos Disc features a unique pictorial script. Although its origin is
        debated, it is now widely believed to be of Cretan origin. Because it is
        the only find of its kind, the script on the Phaistos disc remains
        undeciphered. In addition to the above, five inscriptions dated to the
        7th and 6th centuries BC have been found in Eastern Crete (and possible
        as late as the 3rd century BC) written in an archaic Greek alphabet that
        encode a clearly non-Greek language, dubbed "Eteocretan" (lit. "True
        Cretan"). Given the small number of inscriptions, the language remains
        little-known. Eteocretan inscriptions are separated from Linear A by
        about a millennium, and it is thus unknown if Eteocretan represents a
        descendant of the Minoan language (Wikipedia).

      <h4>Architecture</h4>
      <p>
        Minoan cities were connected by narrow roads paved with blocks cut with
        bronze saws. Streets were drained, and water and sewage facilities were
        available to the upper class through clay pipes. Minoan buildings often
        had flat, tiled roofs; plaster, wood or flagstone floors, and stood two
        to three stories high. Lower walls were typically constructed of stone
        and rubble, and the upper walls of mudbrick. Ceiling timbers held up the
        roofs. Construction materials for villas and palaces varied, and
        included sandstone, gypsum and limestone. Building techniques also
        varied, with some palaces using ashlar masonry and others roughly-hewn,
        megalithic blocks. In north-central Crete blue-greenschist was used as
        to pave floors of streets and courtyards between 1650 and 1600 BC. These
        rocks were likely quarried in Agia Pelagia on the north coast of central
        Crete (Wikipedia).
      </p>

      <h4>Art</h4>
      <h5>Pottery</h5>
      <p>
        Many different styles of potted wares and techniques of production are
        observable throughout the history of Crete. Early Minoan ceramics were
        characterized by patterns of spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses,
        fish bones, and beak-spouts. However, while many of the artistic motifs
        are similar in the Early Minoan period, there are many differences that
        appear in the reproduction of these techniques throughout the island
        which represent a variety of shifts in taste as well as in power
        structures. There were also many small terracotta figurines. During the
        Middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs (such as fish, squid, birds
        and lilies) were common. In the Late Minoan period, flowers and animals
        were still characteristic but more variety existed. However, in contrast
        to later Ancient Greek vase painting, paintings of human figures are
        extremely rare, and those of land mammals not common until late periods.
        Shapes and ornament were often borrowed from metal tableware that has
        largely not survived, while painted decoration probably mostly derives
        from frescos (Wikipedia).
      </p>
      <h5>Jewelry</h5>
      <p>
        Minoan jewellery has mostly been recovered from graves, and until the
        later periods much of it consists of diadems and ornaments for women's
        hair, though there are also the universal types of rings, bracelets,
        armlets and necklaces, and many thin pieces that were sewn onto
        clothing. In the earlier periods gold was the main material, typically
        hammered very thin.[81] but later it seemed to become scarce. The
        Minoans created elaborate metalwork with imported gold and copper. Bead
        necklaces, bracelets and hair ornaments appear in the frescoes, and many
        labrys pins survive. The Minoans mastered granulation, as indicated by
        the Malia Pendant, a gold pendant featuring bees on a honeycomb.[138]
        This was overlooked by the 19th-century looters of a royal burial site
        they called the "Gold Hole".
      </p>

      <h4>Collapse</h4>
      <p>
        Between 1935 and 1939, Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos posited
        the Minoan eruption theory. An eruption on the island of Thera
        (present-day Santorini), about 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Crete,
        occurred during the LM IA period (1550 to 1500 BC). One of the largest
        volcanic explosions in recorded history, it ejected about 60 to 100
        cubic kilometres (14 to 24 cu mi) of material and was measured at 7 on
        the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The eruption devastated the nearby
        Minoan settlement at Akrotiri on Santorini, which was entombed in a
        layer of pumice. Although it is believed to have severely affected the
        Minoan culture of Crete, the extent of its effects has been debated.
        Early theories proposed that volcanic ash from Thera choked off plant
        life on the eastern half of Crete, starving the local population;[169]
        however, more-thorough field examinations have determined that no more
        than 5 millimetres (0.20 in) of ash fell anywhere on Crete.[170] Based
        on archaeological evidence, studies indicate that a massive tsunami
        generated by the Thera eruption devastated the coast of Crete and
        destroyed many Minoan settlements. Although the LM IIIA (late Minoan)
        period is characterized by affluence (wealthy tombs, burials and art)
        and ubiquitous Knossian ceramic styles,[174] by LM IIIB (several
        centuries after the eruption) Knossos' wealth and importance as a
        regional center declined. Significant remains have been found above the
        late Minoan I-era Thera ash layer, implying that the Thera eruption did
        not cause the immediate collapse of Minoan civilization. The Minoans
        were a sea power, however, and the Thera eruption probably caused
        significant economic hardship. Whether this was enough to trigger a
        Minoan downfall is debated. Many archaeologists believe that the
        eruption triggered a crisis, making the Minoans vulnerable to conquest
        by the Mycenaeans. According to Sinclair Hood, the Minoans were most
        likely conquered by an invading force. Although the civilization's
        collapse was aided by the Thera eruption, its ultimate end came from
        conquest. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was destroyed
        by fire, with the palace at Knossos receiving less damage than other
        sites on Crete. Since natural disasters are not selective, the uneven
        destruction was probably caused by invaders who would have seen the
        usefulness of preserving a palace like Knossos for their own use.[176]
        Several authors have noted evidence that Minoan civilization had
        exceeded its environmental carrying capacity, with archaeological
        recovery at Knossos indicating deforestation in the region near the
        civilization's later stages

        famous archeologists that was instrumental to our understanding on the Minoan 
        civilization; Arthur Evans. I used the <h4> tags for the title and the <p>
        tags for the paragraphs. -->
      <h4>The Discoveries of Arthur Evans</h4>
      <p>
        Arthur Evans began excavating on a hill called tou tseleve he kephala,
        "the headland of the chieftain", some three miles (5 km) from the north
        coast of Crete, on March 23, 1900. Two of the palace storerooms had been
        uncovered by Minos Kalokairinos in 1878, whose work ceased at the demand
        of the land owners. Simultaneously, coins and seals inscribed with a
        mysterious script were also discovered. These came to Evans' attention
        as the curator of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, a position he held
        from 1884 to 1908. The area was rumored to have been the site of the
        ancient city of Knossos. Evans examined the site on March 19, 1894. In
        1899 Evans purchased the land with his own funds and decided to set up
        an excavation. In the first two weeks he discovered Linear A tablets.
        Attacking the site with crews of hundreds of diggers, Evans uncovered
        most of the site's 6 acres (24,000 m2) within 6 seasons. By 1905 he had
        named the civilization whose traces he found there Minoan, after the
        legendary king Minos, and had created a detailed chronology of the
        serial phases of the pottery styles in Minoan Crete, based on what he
        found at Knossos. Subsequently, he concerned himself mainly with
        restoration. He continued to excavate there and elsewhere and to restore
        until 1935.In 1921, the first edition of Evans' work on Crete, Palace of
        Minos, was released. On Evans' death in 1941, the British School of
        Archaeology assumed responsibility for the excavation, later turning the
        property over to the Greek government, while retaining excavation
        rights.
