      Apart from the abundant local agriculture, the Minoans were also a
      mercantile people who engaged significantly in overseas trade, and at
      their peak may well have had a dominant position in international trade
      over much of the Mediterranean. After 1700 BC, their culture indicates a
      high degree of organization. Minoan-manufactured goods suggest a network
      of trade with mainland Greece (notably Mycenae), Cyprus, Syria, Anatolia,
      Egypt, Mesopotamia and westward as far as the Iberian peninsula. The term
      palace economy was first used by Evans of Knossos. It is now used as a
      general term for ancient pre-monetary cultures where much of the economy
      revolved around the collection of crops and other goods by centralized
      government or religious institutions (the two tending to go together) for
      redistribution to the population. This is still accepted as an important
      part of the Minoan economy; all the palaces have very large amounts of
      space that seems to have been used for storage of agricultural produce,
      some remains of which have been excavated after they were buried by
      disasters. What role, if any, the palaces played in Minoan international
      trade is unknown, or how this was organized in other ways. The
      decipherment of Linear A would possibly shed light on this (Wikipedia).

    <h4>Language and Writing</h4>
    <p>
      Minoan is an unclassified language, or perhaps multiple indeterminate
      languages written in the same script. It has been compared inconclusively
      to the Indo-European and Semitic language families, as well as to the
      proposed Tyrsenian languages or an unclassified pre-Indo-European language
      family. Several writing systems dating from the Minoan period have been
      unearthed in Crete, the majority of which are currently undeciphered. The
      most well-known script is Linear A, dated to between 2500 BC and 1450 BC.
      Linear A is the parent of the related Linear B script, which encodes the
      earliest known form of Greek.[90] and is also found elsewhere in the
      Aegean. The dating of the earliest examples of Linear B from Crete is
      controversial, but is unlikely to be before 1425 BC; it is assumed that
      the start of its use reflects conquest by Mycenae. Several attempts to
      translate Linear A have been made, but consensus is lacking and Linear A
      is currently considered undeciphered. The language encoded by Linear A is
      tentatively dubbed "Minoan". When the values of the symbols in Linear B
      are used in Linear A, they produce unintelligible words, and would make
      Minoan unrelated to any other known language. There is a belief that the
      Minoans used their written language primarily as an accounting tool and
      that even if deciphered, may offer little insight other than detailed
      descriptions of quantities. Linear A is preceded by about a century by the
      Cretan hieroglyphs. It is unknown whether the language is Minoan, and its
      origin is debated. Although the hieroglyphs are often associated with the
      Egyptians, they also indicate a relationship to Mesopotamian writings.[91]
      They came into use about a century before Linear A, and were used at the
      same time as Linear A (18th century BC; MM II). The hieroglyphs
      disappeared during the 17th century BC (MM III). The Phaistos Disc
      features a unique pictorial script. Although its origin is debated, it is
      now widely believed to be of Cretan origin. Because it is the only find of
      its kind, the script on the Phaistos disc remains undeciphered. In
      addition to the above, five inscriptions dated to the 7th and 6th
      centuries BC have been found in Eastern Crete (and possible as late as the
      3rd century BC) written in an archaic Greek alphabet that encode a clearly
      non-Greek language, dubbed "Eteocretan" (lit. "True Cretan"). Given the
      small number of inscriptions, the language remains little-known.
      Eteocretan inscriptions are separated from Linear A by about a millennium,
      and it is thus unknown if Eteocretan represents a descendant of the Minoan
      language (Wikipedia).
