        According to Homer, Crete had 90 cities. Judging by the palace sites,
        the island was probably
        <b>divided into at least eight political units</b> at the height of the
        Minoan period. The majority of Minoan sites are found in
        <u>central and eastern Crete</u>, with few in
        <u>the western part of the island, especially to the south</u>. There
        appear to have been
        <b
          >four major palaces on the island: Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato
          Zakros</b
        >. At least before a unification under Knossos, north-central Crete is
        thought to have been governed from Knossos, the south from Phaistos, the
        central-eastern region from Malia, the eastern tip from Kato Zakros, the
        west from Kydonia. Smaller palaces have been found elsewhere on the
        island (Wikipedia).

        The Minoans were traders, and their cultural contacts reached the
        <b
          >Old Kingdom of Egypt, copper-containing Cyprus, Canaan and the
          Levantine coast and Anatolia</b
        >. In late 2009 Minoan-style frescoes and other artifacts were
        discovered during excavations of the Canaanite palace at Tel Kabri,
        Israel, leading archaeologists to conclude that the Minoan influence was
        the strongest on the Canaanite city-state (Wikipedia)
      </p>
      <p>
        Minoan techniques and ceramic styles had varying degrees of influence on
        Helladic Greece.
        <u
          >Along with Santorini, Minoan settlements are found at Kastri,
          Kythera</u
        >, an island near the Greek mainland influenced by the Minoans from the
        mid-third millennium BC (EMII) to its Mycenaean occupation in the 13th
        century. Minoan strata replaced a mainland-derived early Bronze Age
        culture, the earliest Minoan settlement outside Crete (Wikipedia).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cyclades were in the Minoan cultural orbit and, closer to Crete, the
        islands of Karpathos, Saria and Kasos also contained middle-Bronze Age
        (MMI-II) Minoan colonies or settlements of Minoan traders. Most were
        abandoned in LMI, but Karpathos recovered and continued its Minoan
        culture until the end of the Bronze Age. Other supposed Minoan colonies,
        such as that hypothesized by Adolf Furtwängler on Aegina, were later
        dismissed by scholars.However, there was a Minoan colony at Ialysos on
        Rhodes (Wikipedia)
      </p>
      <p>
        Minoan cultural influence indicates an orbit extending through the
        Cyclades to Egypt and Cyprus. Fifteenth-century BC paintings in Thebes,
        Egypt depict Minoan-appearing individuals bearing gifts. Inscriptions
        describing them as coming from keftiu ("islands in the middle of the
        sea") may refer to gift-bringing merchants or officials from Crete. Some
        locations on Crete indicate that the Minoans were an "outward-looking"
        society. The neo-palatial site of Kato Zakros is located within 100
        meters of the modern shoreline in a bay. Its large number of workshops
        and wealth of site materials indicate a possible entrepôt for trade.
        Such activities are seen in artistic representations of the sea,
        including the Ship Procession or "Flotilla" fresco in room five of the
        West House at Akrotiri (Wikipedia).
