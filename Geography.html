    <h4>Geographical Location</h4>
<p>According to Homer, Crete had 90 cities.[32] Judging by the palace sites, 
the island was probably divided into at least eight political units at the 
height of the Minoan period. The majority of Minoan sites are found in 
central and eastern Crete, with few in the western part of the island, 
especially to the south. There appear to have been four major palaces on 
the island: Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros. At least before a 
unification under Knossos, north-central Crete is thought to have been 
governed from Knossos, the south from Phaistos, the central-eastern region 
from Malia, the eastern tip from Kato Zakros, the west from Kydonia. Smaller 
palaces have been found elsewhere on the island (Wikipedia).</p>
