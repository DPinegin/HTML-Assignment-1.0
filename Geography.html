    <h4>Geographical Location</h4>
    <p>
      According to Homer, Crete had 90 cities.[32] Judging by the palace sites,
      the island was probably divided into at least eight political units at the
      height of the Minoan period. The majority of Minoan sites are found in
      central and eastern Crete, with few in the western part of the island,
      especially to the south. There appear to have been four major palaces on
      the island: Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Kato Zakros. At least before a
      unification under Knossos, north-central Crete is thought to have been
      governed from Knossos, the south from Phaistos, the central-eastern region
      from Malia, the eastern tip from Kato Zakros, the west from Kydonia.
      Smaller palaces have been found elsewhere on the island (Wikipedia).

      The Minoans were traders, and their cultural contacts reached the Old
      Kingdom of Egypt, copper-containing Cyprus, Canaan and the Levantine coast
      and Anatolia. In late 2009 Minoan-style frescoes and other artifacts were
      discovered during excavations of the Canaanite palace at Tel Kabri,
      Israel, leading archaeologists to conclude that the Minoan influence was
      the strongest on the Canaanite city-state (Wikipedia)

      Minoan techniques and ceramic styles had varying degrees of influence on
      Helladic Greece. Along with Santorini, Minoan settlements are found at
      Kastri, Kythera, an island near the Greek mainland influenced by the
      Minoans from the mid-third millennium BC (EMII) to its Mycenaean
      occupation in the 13th century.[39][40][41] Minoan strata replaced a
      mainland-derived early Bronze Age culture, the earliest Minoan settlement
      outside Crete (Wikipedia).

      The Cyclades were in the Minoan cultural orbit and, closer to Crete, the
      islands of Karpathos, Saria and Kasos also contained middle-Bronze Age
      (MMI-II) Minoan colonies or settlements of Minoan traders. Most were
      abandoned in LMI, but Karpathos recovered and continued its Minoan culture
      until the end of the Bronze Age.[43] Other supposed Minoan colonies, such
      as that hypothesized by Adolf Furtwängler on Aegina, were later dismissed
      by scholars.However, there was a Minoan colony at Ialysos on Rhodes
      (Wikipedia)

      Minoan cultural influence indicates an orbit extending through the
      Cyclades to Egypt and Cyprus. Fifteenth-century BC paintings in Thebes,
      Egypt depict Minoan-appearing individuals bearing gifts. Inscriptions
      describing them as coming from keftiu ("islands in the middle of the sea")
      may refer to gift-bringing merchants or officials from Crete.[46]Some
      locations on Crete indicate that the Minoans were an "outward-looking"
      society. The neo-palatial site of Kato Zakros is located within 100 meters
      of the modern shoreline in a bay. Its large number of workshops and wealth
      of site materials indicate a possible entrepôt for trade. Such activities
      are seen in artistic representations of the sea, including the Ship
      Procession or "Flotilla" fresco in room five of the West House at Akrotiri
      (Wikipedia).
